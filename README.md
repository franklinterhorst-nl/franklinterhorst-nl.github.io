# franklinterhorst.nl

### Why this repo?

As the domain `franklinterhorst.nl` will soon come to an end as the current maintainer is very ill and - according to doctors - will die within a couple of months. And there is no plan to extend and maintain this website after his dead. His domain will be fransfered to this repository.

*Update*: on April 7, 2023 Franklin passed away. His relatives indicate that the domain will continue to exist as long as the government does not take it down because of "disinformation."

> Keep it simple. 
>  1. Put in the title box `A:` if something is added, `C` for changing something, a `R` for removing something and a `M` if something is moved to another file . 
>  2. Put here after the file name of the file you changed
>  3. At the end put the issue number if appliable. 
> So `C: docs/index.html fix #74` or `R: docs/images/... fix #75`. The issue itself will contains all the details.
