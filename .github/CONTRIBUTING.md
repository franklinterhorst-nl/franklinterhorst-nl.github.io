## Rules for Contributing

### Issues 

**Allways** use the issue templates: 
 - use [this template](https://github.com/JohnyP36/JohnyP36.github.io/issues/new?) if you have a question. 
 - for issues regarding a bug or an new feature or request use [this template](https://github.com/JohnyP36/JohnyP36.github.io/issues/new?)
If the issue template isn't followed your issue will be labeled as `invalid` and be closed
---
### Pull requests
Use the template that has been made available for this.
#### Don't pull a request for just one or two (max. four issues). Only pull request if there are a lot of changes at once.

##### VERY IMPORTANT! Changing files in the folder `.github` will put you at the risk of being blocked. Only change files in the `/docs`-folder.
---
### _Commit message_
Keep it simple. 
 1. Put in the title box `A:` if something is added, `C` for changing something, a `R` for removing something and a `M` if something is moved to another file . 
 2. Put here after the file name of the file you changed
 3. At the end put the issue number if appliable. 
So `C: docs/index.html fix #74` or `R: docs/images/... fix #75`. The issue itself will contains all the details.
