# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

If there is a vulnerability in the code of this domain (e.g. in one of the javascript files or the html files) 
**always** make sure you are viewing the **latest/newest** version and if the vulnerability could also be found there.  

Although not necessary a 'vulnerability', you may also report it if you think there is a way to make the website/domain more privacy friendly.  

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is vulnerability in the code or a weakness you can choose between ways to let me know your findings: 
 1. Use the template to [report a bug](https://github.com/franklinterhorst-nl/franklinterhorst-nl.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=other.yml) and pick `other` in the menu below the question *What kind of problem do you encounter?* (if necessary you can also choose `a bug`);
 2. Go to [issues](https://github.com/franklinterhorst-nl/franklinterhorst-nl.github.io/issues/new/choose) and fill in the form [Report a security vulnerability](https://github.com/franklinterhorst-nl/franklinterhorst-nl.github.io/security/advisories/new)

Descriptions that are to vague or to general will be closed and thus declined.  
Normally, within two weeks you will get a response. This means that within two weeks you will get an updated on the reported vulnerability. I may ask you more details or to help with fixing the issue. If the vulnerability is not creating to much risk and/or a fix is not found easy, the vulnerability could also become declined. But as you never know if I will accept it or not, please **always** report it.  

<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. -->
